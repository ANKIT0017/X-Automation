I earned $0 in July.
But I gained:

1400+ new followers on X
8.6M impressions
Met incredible people
Started my own company

Not all wins are financial.
Some are foundational.

i just lost ₹12,000 on Binance P2P this evening.
paid for USDT, but the seller never released it.
shared fake “released” screenshots.

no funds. no help. no closure.

if you're using P2P, double check everything.
 crypto is powerful, but trust is fragile.
