## Overview

This project provides a suite of Python scripts to automate interactions with X (Twitter), including saving session authentication and posting tweets in bulk.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Required packages 

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ANKIT0017/X-Automation.git
   cd X-Automation
Install dependencies:


Important: Before running any scripts, you must save your session:


python save_session.py

This will authenticate and generate a stored session (e.g., session.json) required by other scripts.

After the session is saved, you're ready to post tweets in bulk:


python tweet_bulk.py

Usage

1. Save Session
Run save_session.py to authenticate with the X API and create a saved session file. This ensures subsequent scripts have the necessary credentials to operate.


python save_session.py

Successful execution should produce a session.json (or similarly named file) containing valid session tokens.

2. Send Bulk Tweets
With the session saved, you can now run:


python tweet_bulk.py

This script reads entries (tweets) from a CSV or other structured file (e.g., post.csv) and posts them through the authenticated session.

3. Optional: Tweet Now / Other Scripts
tweet_now.py — send a single tweet immediately.

test_llava_image.py / engaging_images — may handle image generation or testing (adjust per your actual use).

tweet_now.py, test_llava_image.py, and others can all rely on the saved session.

File Descriptions
File / Directory	Description
save_session.py	Authenticates and stores session tokens in a JSON file for reuse.
tweet_bulk.py	Reads multiple tweets from a file and sends them in bulk.
tweet_now.py	Posts a single tweet immediately.
session.json	Generated by save_session.py; used for authenticated API requests.
post.csv / engaging_tweets.csv	CSV files containing tweets to be posted.
replied_log.txt	Logs of tweets or responses that have already been handled.
engaging_images/	Folder for image assets or outputs generated by the project.
test_llava_image.py	Script for testing image generation or manipulation (llava related).

Configuration
Ensure your API credentials are set—either via environment variables or in a config file, as required by your scripts.

Customize CSV formats: define the expected headers (tweet_text, image_path, etc.) based on your data files like post.csv or engaging_tweets.csv.

Log and error handling: monitor replied_log.txt for processed tweets and errors.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests for:

New features (e.g., scheduling tweets, adding media support).

Bug fixes or stability improvements.

Enhanced logging or reporting.

Summary
Important Workflow Reminder:

First, run save_session.py to generate the session file.

Only after, run tweet_bulk.py (or any other dependent scripts).
