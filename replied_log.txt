the funny thing is you can just outwork people.

if you run slightly faster you will eventually lap them.

not that everything is a race...

but any endeavor is a game of effort.

Sleeping without AC in the summer is torture.

It's impossible to fall asleep and have a restful night in the heat.

Your body needs to drop its temperature for it.

If your room is 30°C, this is much harder.

Cool the room down.

xAI's Grok 4 is now the top AI model

Benchmarked against all major models, Grok 4 leads with an AAI Index of 73, ahead of
• o3 at 70
• Gemini 2.5 Pro at 70
• Claude 4 Opus at 64
• DeepSeek R1 0528 at 68

Key highlights
• Best-in-class on Coding, Math, and Reasoning

Grok 4 for coding is next-level. If you code, you need to try it.

Why are you still staying quiet about your project? 

• No launch hype
• Zero feedback
• Invisible growth

But:
Every update, small win, failure, or insight is content waiting to build trust.
Post it. Share it. Learn loud.
Your audience is waiting.

When you're building something new, talk less. Post less.
Silence isn’t weakness, it’s focus.
You don’t owe the world updates during your 0 → 1 phase.
Validate quietly. Ship quietly.
Let your product breathe without noise.

But once it’s ready, go loud.
Post everywhere. Tell
No idea what to post?

Start building. Start marketing. Start failing.
Boom! infinite content.
LLMs do not think.
They just predict one token at a time.
What's wrong in this code and guess the ouput.

#include <stdio.h>

int square(int n){
    n * n;

int main() {
    int n = 10;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
        printf("%d\n", square(i));
    }
    return 0;
}
